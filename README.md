# Professional README Generator

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. After reviewing the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide), a high-quality, professional README should contain what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

This week, I'll create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

The application will be invoked by executing the following command:
'node index.js'

[See Application Demo](LINK)

## User Story

```

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
